<b>Notes about DK Blood</b>:  
Death and Decay usage is wierd if you are using an Generic Unlocker, there's nothing i can do.

I personally don't like automatic DnD usage, i've been using a macro since MrTheSoulz did the NeP.Engine.Cast_Queue, if you care for perfomance you should do it too.


DPS of Blood DK is based on how well you are casting DnD.
